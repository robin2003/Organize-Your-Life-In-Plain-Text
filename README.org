Translate of Org Mode, Organize Your Life In Plain Text


** Usage

There are 1 file and two folders:

| name                   | perpose                                       |
| zh/                    | contain chinese translate version             |
| en/                    | contain original english version              |
| org-mode-translation.org | translate original version section by section |

You can open org-mode-translation.org file in emacs, then use org-babel-tangle
command to regenerate chinese translate document which will output to zh/ folder.

if you find any wrong, you can tell me directly or you can file PR directly.
